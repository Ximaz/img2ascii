# Image to ASCII
This module is based on [zeloww](https://github.com/zeloww/letters)'s repository, but in only includes the ``letters/asciiart.py .img2ascii`` function, that I changed to make it faster.

# How to use ?
-   Clone the repository,
-   Open a new terminal on the repository's folder,
-   Paste an image in the folder you want the ASCII result,
-   Type in the terminal :

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 tests.py <FILENAME>
```
